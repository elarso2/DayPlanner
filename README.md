The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive day planner, in which the user enters an event into a time slot, and that events color changes depending on whether the event is in the present, future, or past. Additionally, the curent date and time are displayed at the top of the page, and when the page is refreshed, the content remains because it has been saved to the session storage.

The site example which we were provided with can be seen below:

The code for the webpage should be coherent, and with frequent comments to increase ease of reading by other developers.
